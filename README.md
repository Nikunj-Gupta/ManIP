# Introduction
This is an IP Asset Management system for an institution.
The Web App helps in managing IP Assets of an organisation. Members can request for a new IP Asset and an Intellectual Property Committee (IPC) accepts or rejects an new request. The stakeholders, copyrights, licensees and the royalty rates are managed on the site. There is an Admin who takes care of IP Policies which the organisation follows.

PHP was used. Many things like UI design came as a learning by-product. Managing Databases for the prime goal.

### Tech

* PHP
* MySQL
* HTML/CSS
